# Inventory Examples

The subdirectories here contain example inventory files for installation of the
Telemetry Framework into an OpenShift environment running within a
hyperconverged oVirt environment.

We also show installation within Red Hat environments (the downstream versions)
which youâ€™ll see in the `nfvha-lab/` inventory for example. These act as
reference examples in a production-style deployment.
